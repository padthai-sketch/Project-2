## Project Title: Real Estate RoboAdvisor

**Team Members**

*Ingrid, Kaleb, Bowie*

**Project Description**
The purpose of our project is to build the RoboAdvisor that helps the prospective homebuyer find their dream home in Austin, Texas. In order to search for the house, the user will be asked to provide neccessary parameters as following. 
- personal annual income, 
- property type, 
- price range, 
- number of bedrooms, 
- number of bathrooms, 
- location, 
- the amount of down payment. 

After that, the bot will generate the list of property that similar to their preference and able to suggest the further process if the user decide to purchase the property. 

**Objectives / Project Questions to Answer**
The Robo Advisor is able to suggest the property that meet the user criteria by filtering through the number of listing and providing the property detail and sale price. We will also explore the possibility of using Google map to show the property in the area.
