The purpose of our project was to build a RoboAdvisor using AWS Lex that helps prospective homebuyers find their dream home in Austin, Texas. This to will act as mix of a mortgage calculator and a real estate website such as Zillow or Redfin. In order to get their recommendation, the user will be asked to provide the neccessary parameters as following:
- Name
- Age
- Credit Score
- Annual Household Income
- Amout Saved for a Downpayment
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms 
- Square Footage


After that information is provided by the user, the bot will generate a list of a few properties that fit their preferences and provide the listings for each property. Don't waste time searching through houses that don't fit your preferences, let Jeffrey do the work for you!


The Robo Advisor is able to suggest properties that meets the user's criteria by filtering through the number of listings in our dataset. We got this dataset from Bridge Interactive, using an API. This includes a large number of listings in Austin, Texas along with all of the property details for each listing.

** We did not have enough time to trobleshoot the problem with Lambda function. Jeffrey would be more efficient if we could fix the issue.
